# CKDProject
Build an LSTM RNN model for chronic kidney disease prediction

## Project Description
### Objective:
To build a model to predict whether a patient will progress in CKD staging or not given the patient's past longitudinal information.

### Dataset:
features: a set of longitudinal data of different lab measurements for patients diagnosed with chronic kidney disease (CKD).

labels: you are also given the information whether these patients progress in their CKD stage or not in the future. (true/false)
